#### Hi, everyone. I am Vince Jang, welcome to my blog. With over a decade of experience in the casino industry, I've decided to embark on a new adventure—transitioning into the world of cybersecurity.

#### This blog serves as a dual purpose. 

 * Firstly, it's my personal project—an online haven where I document my journey, share insights, and keep track of my daily learning experiences in the dynamic field of cybersecurity. 
 
 * Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I aspire for this blog to be a valuable resource for other students who, like me, are just starting their journey into the realm of cybersecurity.



#### Thank you for visiting me on this exciting venture. Here's to learning, evolving, and building a community of aspiring cybersecurity professionals!

#### Warm regards,


#### Vince Jang
