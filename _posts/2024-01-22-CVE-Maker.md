# Vulnerability scan
Vulnerability scanning is the process of discovering, analyzing and reporting on security flaws and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans are conducted via automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential risk exposures and attack vectors across an organization's network, hardware, software and systems. Vulnerability scanning and assessment is an essential step in the Vulnerability management lifecycle.  
once Vulnerabilities have been identified through scanning and assessed, and organization can pursue a remediation path, such as patching vulnerabilities, closing risky ports, fixing misconfigurations, and even changing default passwords, such as on IOT and other devices.

## Benefits of Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is a vital part of your security team's overall IT risk management approach for several reasons

Vulnerability scanning lets you take a proactive approach to close any gaps and maintain strong security for your systems, data, employees, and customers. Data breaches are often the result of unpatched vulnerabilities, so identifying and eliminating these security gaps, removes that attack vector.

Cybersecurity compliance and regulations demand secure systems. For instance, NIST, PCI DSS, and HIPAA all emphasize vulnerability scanning to protect sensitive data.

Cyber criminals also have access to vulnerability scanning tools, so it is vital to carry out scans and take restorative actions before hackers can exploit any security vulnerabilities.

## What to Look for in Vulnerability Scanning and Risk Assessment Tools
The four following capabilities should top your list of priorities when assessing the suitability of a vulnerability scanning for your enterprise:

1. Frequency of updates  
Your vulnerability scanner database should be continually updated with the latest identified vulnerabilities

2. Quality and quantity of vulnerabilities  
Your scanner should strike the right balance between identifying all vulnerabilities, while minimizing false positives and negatives, and providing high-quality information on flaws, threat priorities, and remediation pathways.

3. Actionable results  
Your scanning tool should provide comprehensive reports that allow you to take practical, corrective actions.

4. Integrations  
Your vulnerability scanner should fit seamlessly into your vulnerability management program, which should include patch management and other solutions.

### Expolit Database
![Exploit database](https://www.exploit-db.com/) is a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers.

![images](/assets/img/pic11.2.PNG)  
We can type in the vulnerabilities we are looking for, and this time I will focus on XML vulnerabilities.

![images](/assets/img/pic11.4.PNG)  
we can see all the details for this specific vulnerability.  

### Searchsploit
We are all lazy, and we want to do everything on our Linux machine, right? In that case, we have a default tool in Kali Linux called Searchsploit. It is a command-line tool that allows us to search and browse all the exploits available at ![Exploit database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

Searchsploit offers basic exploit information that can be used with tools like Nmap and others.".

### CVE-MAKER
CVE-Maker is a tool that we can find more details of vulnerabilities
#### Install
`pip3 install cve-maker`  
#### Launch
`python3 -m cve-maker`  
We can see some of the recent critical vulnerabilities (with a high CVSS score) using the command `critical`  
![images](/assets/img/pic11.7.PNG)
now we are going to find vulnerability with the `search` command.  
![images](/assets/img/pic11.8.PNG)  
Now we can even go deeper. using `get` command  
![images](/assets/img/pic11.9.PNG)  
This tool can provide more information than Searchsploit. and It is open source.
